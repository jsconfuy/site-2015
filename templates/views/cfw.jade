          h3 The Selection Process
          p
            | How we choose the workshops:
            ul
              li We anonymize submissions, so we don’t bias against anything related to the author.
              li We follow two rounds of voting:
              li The first round rates each talk on a scale from 1 to 5.
              li Submissions with higher average are rated again on a 3-point scale: “fair”, “good”, “MUST HAVE”.
              li De-anonymize so we can finally bias against author details.
            p
            | We expect many excellent submissions for the speaking slots. This process helps us to select the right ones and play nice.
