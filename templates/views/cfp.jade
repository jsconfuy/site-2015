                b We cover your stay in Montevideo 
                | in a nice hotel (including free Wifi) for the days of the conference two nights before and one after.

          h3 The Selection Process
          p
            | How we choose the talks:
            ul
              li We anonymize submissions, so we don’t bias against anything related to the author.
              li We follow two rounds of voting:
              li The first round rates each talk on a scale from 1 to 5.
              li Submissions with higher average are rated again on a 3-point scale: “fair”, “good”, “MUST HAVE”.
              li De-anonymize so we can finally bias against author details. Based on our budget, we might opt for a local or less expensive to transport author.
            p
            | We expect many excellent submissions for the speaking slots. This process helps us to select the right ones and play nice.

          h3 Guidelines for proposals
          p
            | Submit your proposal by <b>Feb 20th 2015, 23:59:59 UYT(GMT-3).</b>
          p
            | Talks may be in <b>English or Spanish</b>. Please choose the language you feel more comfortable with.
          p
            | <b>Your talk may take 30 minutes</b> (contact us if you need additional time). There is no additional Q&A section. There will be plenty of time during the breaks for further discussion of topics. Due to schedule reasons we strongly recommend timing your presentation in advance (we may be strict with the talk's duration).
          p
            | <b>Make a nice submission,</b> and make sure we see you care about it. Avoid typos, sloppy formatting and all-lowercase text. Be concise: If you need more than two paragraphs to get to the point of your topic, it is likely you won’t make it in 30 minutes. Please make our reading of your proposal easy.
          p
            | <b>Original Topics.</b> We favor original content. If you want to discuss a topic that you have talked about elsewhere, try to add a twist, or new research, or development, something unique. Please bear in mind that we want this conference to be enjoyable for everyone, therefore we expect you to adhere to the JSConf <a href='http://jsconf.com/codeofconduct.html'>code of conduct</a>. And of course, if your talk is plain awesome as it is,  just go for it!
